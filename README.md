## Features  

1. Country Slicer: Easily select a specific country to focus the analysis on. This slicer allows you to choose from a list of available countries.  

2. Top 10 Countries with Active Cases: A card that displays the top 10 countries with the highest number of active COVID-19 cases. This provides a quick overview of the current hotspots.  

3. Recovered vs New Cases: A card that showcases the trend of recovered cases compared to new cases over time. This helps to understand the rate of recovery and the ongoing spread of the virus.  

4. State Population and Total Testing: Gain insights into the population of the selected country and the total number of COVID-19 tests conducted. This information provides context for the infection rate and testing efforts.  

5. Pie Chart for Total Cases, Deaths, and Recovered: A pie chart visualization that represents the distribution of total COVID-19 cases among total deaths, recovered cases, and active cases.  

## Usage  
1. Data Refresh: The project is connected to a data source (e.g., a CSV file or an online data repository). To keep the data up to date, you can configure data refresh settings in Power BI.  

2. Interact with Visualizations: Use the provided slicer to select a specific country. Explore the various cards and the pie chart by interacting with them. Hover over elements for additional details.
